# React + Vite 🚀

Welcome to the Hypertensi-Prevention project. This initiative aims to assist in preventing hypertension by offering tools and resources based on user behavior and algorithms, with data stored in Firestore. The system includes features such as monitoring vital signs, sending alerts for abnormal readings, providing educational materials, and offering community support.

## Hypertension Prevention System (Yeah, We’re Working On It 💀)
Look, we didn’t just throw this together for the vibes—this system’s here to keep those blood pressure levels chill, fr fr (eventually). It’s still cooking, but here’s what we plan to drop:

- 📊 Vibe Check, FR: Tracks your BP and vitals ‘cause, you know, health 💅.
- 🔔 Panic Alert: Gets jumpy with notifications if your readings go whoa 🤯.
- 📚 Health Wisdom: Handy tips so you don’t go full hypertensive mode 👀.
- 🤝 Squad Support: Link up with folks who get it for some community feels 💖.



## Chat AI Feature (GPT, No Cap 🤌)
Oh, and yeah, we cooked up a Chat AI—powered by GPT, ‘cause you deserve only the best. Think of it as your slightly unhinged, way-too-smart friend who’s down to chat whenever. Here’s what’s up:

- 💬 Real-Time Chat (Prolly): You got questions? Might answer ‘em, might ghost you—we keep it unpredictable 💀.
- 🔍 Instant Brain Dump: Skip Google; this thing's like the Wikipedia deep dive you didn’t know you needed 💀💀.
- 🧠 Smarter Than Your Ex, FR: Comes with IQ, EQ, and zero chill—won't ghost you either 💀🧠.
No Stupid Questions (Deadass): Toss it whatever, from your deepest fears to snack recs. It’s gotchu 💀.
- More upgrades coming... if we don’t catch a nap first 😭💀

Stay tuned for more wild updates as we keep leveling up this feature! 🚀💀 If we’re not too busy scrolling through TikTok, that is 😭💅. Buckle up, it’s about to get chaotic! ✌️✨
