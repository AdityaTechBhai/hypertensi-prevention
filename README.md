# React + Vite 🚀

Welcome to the Hypertensi-Prevention project! This project aims to help prevent hypertension by providing tools and resources based on user behavior and simple algorithms, with data stored in Firestore. The system includes features such as monitoring vital signs, sending alerts for abnormal readings, offering educational materials, and providing community support.

## Professionalism and Quality Assurance

We take pride in the professionalism and quality of this project. Our team (well, actually just two of us) is dedicated to maintaining high standards in every aspect of development, ensuring that the final product is robust, reliable, and user-friendly. Here are some of the measures we have implemented to achieve this:

- **Code Quality**: We adhere to strict coding standards and best practices, with regular code reviews and automated linting to maintain clean and consistent code.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing is conducted at every stage of development, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure the functionality and stability of the application.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation is provided to help users and contributors understand the project structure, setup, and usage.
- **Continuous Integration**: We use continuous integration (CI) pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that every change is thoroughly tested before being merged.
- **User Feedback**: We actively seek and incorporate user feedback to improve the application and address any issues promptly.

By focusing on these key areas, we aim to deliver a high-quality product that meets the needs of our users and stands out in the industry.

## System Hypertensi-Prevention (Currently Under Development)

This project also includes a system for hypertensi-prevention, which is currently under development. The goal of this system is to provide tools and resources to help prevent hypertension through various features such as:

- **📊 Monitoring**: Track blood pressure and other vital signs.
- **🔔 Alerts**: Receive notifications for abnormal readings.
- **📚 Education**: Access educational materials on hypertension prevention.
- **🤝 Community Support**: Connect with others for support and advice.
## Chat AI Feature (GPT Wrapper)

We are excited to introduce a new feature in our project: a Chat AI powered by GPT! This feature leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT model to provide an interactive chat experience. Here are some of the key functionalities:

- **💬 Interactive Chat**: Engage in real-time conversations with the AI.
- **🔍 Information Retrieval**: Ask questions and get accurate answers based on the latest information.
- **🧠 Intelligent Responses**: Experience natural and context-aware interactions.


3. **Ask Questions**: Simply type your questions and receive responses from the AI.

This Chat AI feature will help patients by providing instant access to information and support, making it easier to manage their health and stay informed.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance this feature.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop and enhance this system.
